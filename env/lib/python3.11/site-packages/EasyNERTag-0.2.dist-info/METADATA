# EasyNERTag: Easy tagging for annotate NER corpus

> Easy tagging for annotate NER corpus

This is tool for helping you to create named entity recognition corpus in conll2002 format. It wants just a tag like [BBCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode).

## Install

> pip install easynertag

## How to use

```
I will see you at 10.04 A.M.
10.04 A.M. is the time for me.
```

From simple data, I want to build NER corpus for time tagging. It wants the time tag. I just add [time] before the start entity and [\time] after the end entity. like this;

```
I will see you at [TIME]10.04 A.M.[/TIME]
[TIME]10.04 A.M.[/TIME] is the time for me.
```

Next, build the NER Corpus

```python
data = """I will see you at [TIME]10.04 A.M.[/TIME]
[TIME]10.04 A.M.[/TIME] is the time for me."""

list_data = data.splitlines()

# Next EasyNERTag
from easynertag import Engine
build = Engine()

conll2002_list = []

for i in list_data:
    conll2002_list.append(build.text2conll2002(i))

print('\n'.join(conll2002_list))
```

output:

```
I       O
will    O
see     O
you     O
at      O
        O
10.04   B-TIME
A.M.    I-TIME

10.04   B-TIME
A.M.    I-TIME
        O
is      O
the     O
time    O
for     O
me.     O
```

You can custom the `word_tokenize` and the `pos_tag` in the Engine class.

```
Engine(
    word_tokenize = function for do word tokenize (default is white_space_split),
    pos_tag: function for do part of speech tagging
)
```

You can see the custome `pos_tag` in `tests/test_make_tag.py`.
